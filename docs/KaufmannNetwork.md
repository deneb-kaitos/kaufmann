## Who is the counterparty

A counterparty can be:

1. a [Sales Person](#a-sales-person)
2. a [Consumer](#a-consumer)
3. a [Supplier](#a-supplier)

### A Sales Person

A `Sales Person` is an individual who can onboard other `Sales Persons`, `Consumers`, and `Suppliers`.

### A Consumer

A `Consumer` is an individual or a company that uses the Kaufmann Network to buy goods from `Suppliers`.

### A Supplier

A `Supplier` is an individual or a company that uses the Kaufmann Network to sell their goods to `Consumers`.

## How a counterparty joins the Kaufmann Network

The Kaufmann Company or a counterparty issues a special [PIN](PIN.md) for a subject who wants to join the Kaufmann Network.

The subject then, using a special application ( e.g. the [Sales App](SalesApp.md) ), types in the `PIN` received which effectively authenticates the subject. The subject then completes their profile in the app.

The same workflow holds true for other types of counterparties.

## How a counterparty restores their connection w/ the Kaufmann Network

Whenever a counterparty loses their access to the Kaufmann Network, they refer to at least 75% of their own counterparties for [Access Regain PIN](PIN.md#access-regain-pin)s.

These `PIN`s should then be provided to the application the counterparty normally uses. Upon that the Kaufmann Network would give the counterparty their access to their account back.

## How a counterparty leaves the Kaufmann Network

There must be a special button that will deactivate a counterparty's account, and, if the counterparty does not have any indebtedness/liabilities the counterparty's account gets deleted completely.

Upon deletion, all the data that refers to this deleted account must be anonymized (if it has any value for the Kaufmann), or deleted completely otherwise.
